{% capture billboard_description %}

Spring Cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build some of
the common patterns in distributed systems (e.g. configuration
management, service discovery, circuit breakers, intelligent routing,
micro-proxy, control bus, one-time tokens, global locks, leadership
election, distributed sessions, cluster state). Coordination of
distributed systems leads to boiler plate patterns, and using Spring
Cloud developers can quickly stand up services and applications that
implement those patterns. They will work well in any distributed
environment, including the developer's own laptop, bare metal data
centres, and managed platforms such as Cloud Foundry.

{% capture main_content %}

Spring Cloud builds on Spring Boot by providing a bunch of libraries
that enhance the behaviour of an application when added to the
classpath. You can take advantage of the basic default behaviour to
get started really quickly, and then when you need to, you can
configure or extend to create a custom solution.

## Quick Start

The release train label (see below) is actually only used
explicitly in one artifact: "spring-cloud-starter-parent" (all the
others have normal "Spring" release labels tied to their parent
project). The starter parent is the one you can use as a BOM for
dependency management or as a parent POM (Maven only). Example using
the latest version with the config client and eureka (change the
artifact ids to pull in other starters):

## Release Trains

Spring Cloud is an umbrella project consisting of independent projects with, in principle, different
release cadences. To manage the protfolio a BOM (Bill of Materials) is published with a curated
set of dependencies on the individual project (see below). The release trains have names, not
versions, to avoid confusion with the sub-projects. The names are an alphabetic sequence (so
you can sort them chronologically) with names of London Tube stations ("Angel" is the first
release, "Brixton" is the second). When point releases of the individual projects accumulate to 
a critical mass, or if there is a critical bug in one of them that needs to be available to everyone,
the release train will push out "service releases" with names ending ".SRX", where "X"
is a number.

Release train contents:

|Component|Angel.SR5                   | Brixton.M4    | Brixton.BUILD-SNAPSHOT |

|spring-boot            | 1.2.8.RELEASE| 1.3.1.RELEASE | 1.3.2.BUILD-SNAPSHOT   |

The Angel release train builds on Spring Boot 1.2.x, and is
incompatible in some areas with Spring Boot 1.3.x. Brixton builds on
Spring Boot 1.3.x and is similarly incompatible with 1.2.x. Some
libraries and most apps built on Angel will run fine on Brixton, but
changes will be required anywhere that the OAuth2 features from
spring-cloud-security 1.0.x are used (they were mostly moved to Spring
Boot in 1.3.0).

Use your dependency management tools to control the version. If you
are using Maven remember that the first version declared wins, so
declare the BOMs in order, with the first one usually being the most
recent (e.g. if you want to use Spring Boot 1.3.2 with Brixton.M4, put
the Boot BOM first). The same rule applies to Gradle if you use the
Spring dependency management plugin.

> NOTE: starting from snapshots after Brixton.M4 the release train contains a
> `spring-cloud-starter-dependencies` as well as the
> `spring-cloud-starter-parent`. Use the parent as you would
> the `spring-boot-starter-parent` (if you are using Maven).
> If you only need dependency management, the "dependencies"
> version is a BOM-only version of the same thing (it just
> contains dependency management and no plugin declarations
> or direct references to Spring or Spring Boot).
