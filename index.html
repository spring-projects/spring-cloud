{% capture billboard_description %}

Spring Cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build some of
the common patterns in distributed systems (e.g. configuration
management, service discovery, circuit breakers, intelligent routing,
micro-proxy, control bus, one-time tokens, global locks, leadership
election, distributed sessions, cluster state). Coordination of
distributed systems leads to boiler plate patterns, and using Spring
Cloud developers can quickly stand up services and applications that
implement those patterns. They will work well in any distributed
environment, including the developer's own laptop, bare metal data
centres, and managed platforms such as Cloud Foundry.

Spring Cloud builds on Spring Boot by providing a bunch of libraries
that enhance the behaviour of an application when added to the
classpath. You can take advantage of the basic default behaviour to
get started really quickly, and then when you need to, you can
configure or extend to create a custom solution. 

<span id="quick-start"></span>
## Quick Start

You can create a Config Server with a single annotation:

```groovy
@Configuration
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@EnableConfigServer
class ConfigServer {
}
```

This app runs from the Spring Boot CLI (once the `spring-cloud-cli`
extensions are installed), e.g.

```
$ spring install org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-cli:1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT
$ spring run configserver.groovy -- --server.port=8888
```

Any other local application that includes `spring-cloud-config` as a
dependency will be able to contact this server and pre-initialize the
Spring `Environment` with external configuration managed by the
server. The Spring Boot CLI (with the Cloud extensions) will do this
automatically for all applications.

```groovy
@Configuration
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@Controller
class ConfigClient {
}
```

Run this app with the Spring Boot CLI and then visit
http://localhost:8080/env (the `Environment` endpoint). Notice the
property sources that come from the config server at the top of the
results.

(N.B. does not work if you can't connect to
[github.com](https://github.com) because that's where the default
configuration repository lives.)

## Features

Spring Cloud focuses on providing good out of box experience for typical use cases and extensibility mechanism to cover others. 

* Distributed/versioned configuration
* Service registration and discovery
* Routing
* Service-to-service calls
* Load balancing
* Circuit Breakers
* Global locks
* Leadership election and cluster state
* Distributed messaging

## Main Projects

<!-- Spring Cloud Config -->
{% capture project_description %}
Centralized external configuration management backed by a git repository. The configuration resources map directly to Spring `Environment` but could be used by non-Spring applications if desired.
